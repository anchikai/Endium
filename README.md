Endium is a new material which can be found generating as an ore in The End at y32 and below and can be found in loot chests in end cities.
Endium is meant to be an alternative to Netherite, so it has its up and downsides compared to it.
### Endium Items
Endium is not fire resistant, but is rather gravity resistant. Endium items in the world will not be affected by gravity and will hover over the void if the player dies with any.
### Endium Tools
Endium tools mine twice as quickly as Netherite, but also have half the durability. Endium will also do one extra damage compared to Netherite.
### Endium Armor
Endium armor is just as strong as Diamond, but has half the durability of Netherite.
If you have at least 2 pieces of Endium armor on, you will not be affected by gravity while sneaking.

### Amaranth & Cobbled End Stone
Amaranth is a new wood type that can be found in the end very rarely. There is a 1/1250 chance for a chunk to contain an Amaranth tree, given if there is land for one to spawn on. Chorus Plants also has a 5% chance to drop an Amaranth Sapling instead of Chorus Fruit.
After getting a wood pickaxe with your new Amaranth wood, you can then mine End Stone to get Cobbled End Stone, which can be used just like any other cobblestone.

### Crafting
After obtaining raw Endium from Endium Ore, it can be smelted in a furnace or blast furnace to gain Endium Scrap. 4 Endium Scrap and 4 Echopearls will grant 1 Endium Ingot.
To craft an Echopearl, just combine an Echo Shard and an Ender Pearl in a crafting table.
Once you have an Endium Ingot, it can be combined with Diamond gear in a smithing table just like Netherite.
You can also craft decoration blocks with either 9 Endium Ingots or 9 Raw Endium in a crafting table.
Finally, you can craft anything like fences, slabs, stairs, buttons, and so on with Amaranth and walls, slabs, and stairs with Cobbled End Stone.
